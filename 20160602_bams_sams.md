## Review of commands

`pwd` print working directory

`cd` change directory

`rm` remove file

`rm -r` remove directory

`ls -lh` list contents of directory in **l**ong form, **h**uman-readable

  > human-readable displays file sizes in MB, GB, etc. rather than bytes
  
`ls -a` list all contests if directory, including secret files

  > secret files start with `.`
  
  > `.timsfile.txt` can't see
  
  > `timsfile.txt` can see
  
`cp` copy file

`cp -r` copy directory

`ssh` log into a server

  > **ssh** = **s**ecure **sh**ell
  
  > Can't do anything computationally heavy on the Broad server (ex. Gold)
  
  > **ssh** lets you into the Broad's house
  
  > **qrsh** lets you sit at a particular computer and work
  
`qrsh -q interactive` log into the qsub server (a Broad cluster)

`>` write to a file

`>>` append to a file

`|` pipe (chain commands together)

`less` opens up a portion of a file in read-only format (can see zipped files)

`cat` prints everything to screen, particularly useful when file is input into a pipe (cannot see zipped files)

`zcat` updated `cat` command that can print zipped files to screen

`mkdir` make directory

`use` use dockit tools present on Broad server (ex. `use uger`)

`hptmp` scratch space

  > Each user has roughly 2 TB of space (actually goes up to 3-3.5 TB before being locked out)
  
  > Great to run pipelines here
  
  > Files 2 weeks old will be deleted
  
  > Scratch space means that your work here is **not** backed up (ex. think of this space as a digital scratch pad)
  
  > You should move important files into established directories accordingly
